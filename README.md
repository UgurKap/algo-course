# Algorithm Implementations

This is a repo where I upload my implementations of various algorithms we examine on our school. I also add homework files when it is applicable(i.e. if homework requires programming, I upload its programming part.). So far, I have implemented these:

## Sorting Algorithms  

These algorithm implementations can be found on sorts.h file.

1. Insertion Sort  
    An in-place sorting algorithms with worst case running time scenario <img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/O(n%5E2)" />.
2. Merge Sort  
    An algorithm that uses divide and conquer. Its running time is <img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%5CTheta(nlgn)" />
3. Quick Sort  
    Another sorting algorithm that uses divide and conquer method. Worst case running time <img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/O(n%5E2)" /> but expected running time is <img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/O(nlgn)"/>.

## Data Structures

1. [Red Black Tree](https://github.com/UgurKap/algorithm-implementations/blob/master/Red%20Black%20Tree/RedBlackTree.cpp)  
    Red Black Trees are special kind of binary search trees where tree is guaranteed to be in balance. Tree size is lgn at most.
2. [Order Statistic Tree](https://github.com/UgurKap/algorithm-implementations/blob/master/Order%20Statistic%20Tree/OrderStatisticTree.cpp)  
    In this repo, you can find an order statistic tree based on red black trees. Order statistic tree is an efficient tree structure to get the ith smallest item where i is an index of your choice.

3. [Minimum Heap](https://github.com/UgurKap/algorithm-implementations/blob/master/HW2/main.cpp)  
    Priority queue implementation using minimum heaps.
